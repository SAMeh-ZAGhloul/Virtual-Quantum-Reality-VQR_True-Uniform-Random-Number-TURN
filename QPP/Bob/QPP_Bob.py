# This version features communications using JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP.
#
# The new Jupyter notebook Bob_agent.ipynb must be run first to start a receiver agent
# which functions as a uvicorn server and receives a file using:
# * üõ∞Ô∏è FastAPI on the server (Remote Agent)
# * üì° requests module on the client
# * üì¶ File content encoded in Base64
# * üåê JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP
#
# Alice Jupyter notebook instantiates a SenderAgent and sends three files to Bob receiver agent with the send_file method using:
# * üì° requests module
# * üì¶ File content encoded in Base64
# * üåê JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP
#
# Last Bob Jupyter notebook process the files received from Alice sender agent.

# FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

# A2A leverages JSON-RPC 2.0 as the data exchange format for communication between a Client and a Remote Agent.
