## Set up and save your IBM Cloud account on the upgraded IBM Quantum Platform (optional) 
Refer to [this guide](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/cloud-setup) for details on how to set up your IBM Cloud account on the upgraded IBM Quantum Platform.

In order to run [QPP_Alice.ipynb](https://github.com/AlainChance/QPP-Alain/blob/main/Alice/QPP_Alice.ipynb) and [QPP_Bob.ipynb](https://github.com/AlainChance/QPP-Alain/blob/main/Bob/QPP_Bob.ipynb) on the upgraded IBM Quantum Platform, either save your credentials before running them or copy your API token in a file named "Token.txt", copy the CRN code associated with your instance in a file named "CRN.txt" and then copy both files in the directory that contains the jupyter notebooks.

## 1. Run [Bob_agent.ipynb](https://github.com/AlainChance/QPP-Alain/blob/main/Bob/Bob_agent.ipynb) 
It starts a receiver agent which functions as a uvicorn server and receives a file using:
* üõ∞Ô∏è FastAPI on the server (Remote Agent)
* üì° requests module on the client
* üì¶ File content encoded in Base64
* üåê JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP

## 2. Run [QPP_Alice.ipynb](https://github.com/AlainChance/QPP-Alain/blob/main/Alice/QPP_Alice.ipynb)
When the receiver agent is not reachable, the following prompt is displayed:
- `Start a receiver agent with Bob_agent.ipynb - and enter 'y' when done`

Answer the following prompt:
- `Start Gradio UI interface? (y/n)`

### QPP setup with Gradio UI
The following message is printed:
- `Running Gradio UI on local URL: http://127.0.0.1:7860`

Open URL `http://127.0.0.1:7860` and set up a configuration, see the example shown below:

![QPP_config_and_run.png](https://github.com/AlainChance/QPP_Alain/blob/main/QPP_2_qubits/le-mont-saint-michel-normandy-france/Alice/QPP_config_and_run.png)

Complete the QPP setup and answer the following prompts:
- `QPP configuration with Gradio complete? (y/n)`
- `Run QPP simulation? (y/n)`

### QPP setup with prompts 
1/ Answer the following prompts:
- `Enter plaintext filename (.txt or .png or .jpg)`
- `Enter number of qubits between 2 and 9`
- `Enter version 0 (n qubits) or 1 (2**n qubits which only uses swap gates)`
- `Enter trace level 0 or 1`
- `Enter 0 for classical simulation or 1 for running on a real QPU or a simulation with AerSimulator`
- `Enter IBM cloud backend name or 'None' to assign least busy device to backend or 'AerSimulator noiseless'`

If the answer is in `['None', 'ibm_sherbrooke', 'ibm_brisbane', 'ibm_torino']` then answer the following prompt:
- `Enter maximum number of permutations in pad between 0 (no maximum) and 56`.

### QPP simulation
The secret key, QPP parameters and ciphertext files are sent to Bob receiver agent with the send_file method using:
* üì° requests module
* üì¶ File content encoded in Base64
* üåê JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP

### Saving the content of the Alice directory
Following the message in bold: "Do a File Save of this notebook":
- `Do you want to save the content of the Alice directory? (y/n)`
If the answer is "y" then Alice directory is copied into a new directory. 

## 3. Run [QPP_Bob.ipynb](https://github.com/AlainChance/QPP-Alain/blob/main/Bob/QPP_Bob.ipynb)
It does the following: 

1/ Prompt
- `Enter version 0 (n qubits) or 1 (2**n qubits which only uses swap gates)`

2/ Decrypt the text or the image file received from Alice using the Json parameter file and the secret key file.

3/ Print in bold `Do a File Save of this notebook` and then prompts:
- `Do you want to save the content of the Bob directory? (y/n)`
If the answer is "y" then copy Bob directory into a new one. 

## Compatible Qiskit versions
These Jupyter notebooks work with Python 3.13 and the following Qiskit versions:
- Qiskit v2.1, Qiskit runtime 0.40, Qiskit Aer 0.17

Open Plan users cannot submit session jobs. Workloads must be run in job mode or batch mode, https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/run-jobs-session

Please refer to the Qiskit documentation in section References below.
